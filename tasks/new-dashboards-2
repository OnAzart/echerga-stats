You are a top tier engineer.

Generate dashboards based on research/dashboard-ideas.md documentation ideas. 

Dashboards to be implemented:
1. Week-over-Week Comparison
Important that it should be visible on a dashboard a line from previous week in another style (dotted, less bright, whatever). And for current day we see queue till current hour - we want to see full line for previous week
I like current dashboard, so keep such formating, "line" is abstract in previous sentance.

2. Best Time Heatmap
so we have general data overweek below other dashboards.
